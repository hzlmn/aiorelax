# aiorelax :cocktail:

CouchDB driver for asyncio without pain in ass.

## Why another client?
 There is `aiocouchdb` that is pretty good, but it is not actively supported.
 Also it works only on old versions of aiohttp and CouchDB. This library aims to change this.

## Features

  * Simple and tiny
  * Support latest stable `CouchDB` but also compatible with older versions
  * Python3.5+
